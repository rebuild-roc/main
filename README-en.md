# Infrastructures of China in Information Times

The evil Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its evil government can be overthrown
by means of the following systems:
* a cryptocurrency to take the place of Renminbi (RMB), the Chinese currency
   issued by CCP government; and
* a decentralized reputation-certification system to perform as a government
   at its best.

When the above systems run for longer and longer, the people of China could be
well organized into a normal society, and the economy in China could be
gradually controlled and managed by the above systems, letting CCP loose its
finance resources and its power. When CCP is too weak to control its military
forces, a provisional government can be established to accept and manage
military forces rebelled against CCP.

Before this occurs, various drafts of and proposals for the Constitution of
a democratic China will be developed in a GitHub repository, together backed up
in a repository within the I2P network.
